# Namespaced, refactored PHP Thumb

This is a refactoring of the excellent [http://phpthumb.gxdlabs.com](http://phpthumb.gxdlabs.com)

Basically, i was in the need of having a namespaced version of PHP Thumb, and 
before i knew it i ended up with a refactored simpler version, of PHP Thumb.

Checkout the code, and give it a try, if your needs are the same. 
Everything should be pretty self explanatory.

As with the original PHP Thumb, my (re)work is released under MIT license.
